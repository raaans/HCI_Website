            <h1>Guest Speakers</h1>
            <p>During the HCI course our lecturers arranged for four speakers to give a talk, which I found really cool. It's nice to hear from some other people who have wildly different experiences and perspectives from the field! I must say that I found all speakers interesting in their own way, but Vincent Lindeboom's talk really excited me and gave me some perspectives on cool new ways you can use interaction.</p>

            <h3>Next Empire</h3>
            <p>Vincent is the founder of a company called 'Next Empire', which focuses on interactive apps and experiences. They do really broad work, from making a <a href="https://nextempire.net/experiences/zoetrope" target="_blank">Coca-Cola Zoethrope</a> for the Efteling to designing a <a href="https://nextempire.net/experiences/duco" target="_blank">chatbot</a> that helps milennials with the national elections. The way he runs the company I found very interesting: it's very network-based and he hires freelancers from his network for each project to make sure the project has just the right talent for the job. </p>

            <h3>Slaapwandeling (Sleepwalk)</h3>
            <p>One of the projects he spoke about, and the one I wanted to highlight here, is "Slaapwandeling". It's an app his company made for the Artis Zoo. The thing that spoke to me was that it gives visitors an entirely new way to interact with a zoo. Normally, a zoo is rather passive: you walk around in whichever way seems most fun and you look at the animals. Maybe you follow a guided tour, which makes it even more passive. With sleepwalk, you're allowed into the zoo past closing time and you get to discover a number of spots in the zoo through the app, which tracks your location through GPS and bluetooth beacons.</p>

            <p>There's no predetermined route, but you do have a map of the zoo with the aforementioned spots to visit. The app gives you specific information when you visit each spot.</p>

            <img src="/images/slaapwandeling.png" alt="screenshots from the artis slaapwandeling app, showing a map with 14 locations, a detail page with info about the Fennek and the main page">

            <p>Each spot has more information about the animal there, why it is special and a challenge that the visitors can do themselves. I really liked this part, because it changes the passive zoo dynamic to an active and interactive one: You are encouraged to 'collect' all 14 animals (some gamification as well!) and you have something to do when you actually find the location. One example is that you have to balance on one leg for 30 seconds when you visit the flamingo pen. Here the app tracks your balance using the internal gyroscope of your phone. I think that's much more exciting than just sauntering about the zoo and seeing which animals make the funniest movements.</p>

            <p>I found it really interesting that here, your phone is used as a way to really interact with the environment. Through your location (and other sensors depending on which challenge you're doing), you interact with the zoo in a new way. It's not even human-computer interaction anymore really. The computer is used as a translation layer between you and the location you're in. And I just thought that was really cool. Also visiting a zoo at night is something you don't normally get to do!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately they didn't list this particular product on their website. They do list <a href="https://nextempire.net/products/moord-in-artis-murder-in-the-zoo" target="_blank">Murder in Artis</a>, another cool interactive experience in the zoo. </p>
