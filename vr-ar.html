            <h1>VR &amp; AR Challenge</h1>
            <p>In this challenge, I'll be researching, designing and building a "novel interactive experience" using VR and/or AR. I'd like to preface this by saying I really struggled with these challenges, especially in the context of the Coronavirus lockdown. </p>

            <p>I'm pretty bad at these very broad "come up with something new" exercises in general. I have ADHD, and one of the things I have trouble with most are assignments without clear boundaries or specific tasks. These challenges are a great example of that: I'm supposed to come up with "something new", and that's all the direction you're gonna get. Usually I manage quite well with this by using the structure of a team or ideating with classmates, so I can play to my own strengths. Right now though, I'm at home and I'm doing this as a resit from last year, so none of my classmates are doing HCI and they're all busy with their graduation.</p>

                <p>Inspiration is an important part of the design process, so first I set out to find interesting projects in the VR/AR space.</p>

                <h3>Bravemind - VRET (Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy)</h3>
                <p>Although I genuinely think that gaming and other passtimes are vitally important, I find myself more drawn to social and practical applications of VR. </p>

                <p>Bravemind is an example of one of those applications. It’s a VR application designed by the University of Southern California to help soldiers in dealing with their PTSD. VR is especially helpful in this field, because it can take up all senses and truly immerse you. They describe that people who didn’t respond to traditional exposure treatments (using more static images or movies), responded well to VRET. </p>

                <p>Another advantage is that it’s very scalable, i.e. the therapist can easily decide how much exposure the patient gets and how intense the exposure is.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Rijksuniversiteit Groningen - VR-CGT (VR Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy)</h3>
                <p>The university of Groningen has done similar research to what I described before: they are using VR to help schizophrenic patients cope with their mental illness. </p>

                <p>On their website, they highlight the case of Edwin, one of the patients treated with VR. What I thought was interesting is that Edwin actually does go outside, but still has trouble with his illness. This tells me that it’s different than just exposure therapy, since he does actually expose himself to the thing he’s afraid of. </p>

                <p>VR-CGT is more therapeutic than just exposure therapy, where the therapist actually discusses the encounters with the patient and guides them to get more in touch with what they’re feeling and why they are feeling it. </p>

                <h3>UMC Groningen - VRelax</h3>
                <p>Depression is a huge problem in society – according to the WHO, some 4.4% of the world population suffers from depression. UMC Groningen says Virtual Reality can help treat this by putting the patient inside a calming, natural environment.</p>

                <h3>Within - Supernatural</h3>
                <p>I’m a huge fan of gamification. I’ve been using it myself in a few instances and I’ve seen what it can do to put yourself into a different state of mind. In some ways you’re essentially tricking your brain into thinking that you’re doing something fun, while you’re actually doing something boring. </p>

                <p>Supernatural is one of those projects that gamifies personal health. Everyone wants to be fit in their own way, but not everyone actually takes the step to work on it. And if they do, most people stop after it’s no longer a new experience and eating healthy and going to the gym starts to become boring. On one hand, going to the gym often takes too much effort; you have to get into your gym outfit, actually go there, interact with people, etc. On the other hand, having a home gym can take away some of this effort, but it isn’t really feasible for most people. </p>

                <p>I think VR can play a big role in this. VR can make doing workouts at home interesting and make sure it’s a new experience every time. I like the direction Supernatural is taking. A lot of people are already using games like Beatsaber as a workout – imagine what a VR app like Supernatural that’s tailor-made for providing you with a workout can do for the fitness industry! It’s a shame that right now it just kind of looks like Beatsaber but in a realistic landscape and with a coach…</p>

                <h3>Within - Sanctuaries of Silence</h3>
                <p>The realistic landscapes I described in the previous paragraph was also a point of inspiration, but for the opposite reason. People see too little nature these days, and there isn’t much quiet either. </p>

                <p>As I said in the VRelax section, being in a natural environment can help with feelings of stress and depression. With an experience like Sanctuaries of Silence, you can use VR to transport yourself to a natural location and - when you use proper (noise-cancelling) earphones - experience some quiet as well.</p>

                <h3>Blender</h3>
                <p>A friend of mine was heavily advocating the use of Blender stuff, saying that it’s so much better and easier to use than Unreal. I didn’t particularly like Unreal myself, so I thought it would be a good point to start off.</p>

                <p>I first watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6" target="_blank">a number of videos about the basics of Blender</a>, and things clicked a lot faster than they did with Unreal, though that could also be attributed to the fact that this intro was a lot clearer.</p>

                <p>The sculpting workspace spoke to me, so that's where I started experimenting. I grabbed my Wacom, sat myself down comfortably, and just kinda let myself go. I have no idea what it is, but this is what came out:</p>
