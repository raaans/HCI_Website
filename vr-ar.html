            <h1>VR &amp; AR Challenge</h1>
            <p>In this challenge, I'll be researching, designing and building a "novel interactive experience" using VR and/or AR. I'd like to preface this by saying I really struggled with these challenges, especially in the context of the Coronavirus lockdown. </p>

            <p>I'm pretty bad at these very broad "come up with something new" exercises in general. I have ADHD, and one of the things I have trouble with most are assignments without clear boundaries or specific tasks. These challenges are a great example of that: I'm supposed to come up with "something new", and that's all the direction you're gonna get. Usually I manage quite well with this by using the structure of a team or ideating with classmates, so I can play to my own strengths. Right now though, I'm at home and I'm doing this as a resit from last year, so none of my classmates are doing HCI and they're all busy with their graduation.</p>
