            <h1>Arduino workshops</h1>
            <p>In these workshops, we learn to program hardware (such as servo-motors, LED displays, etc) with the help of an Adruino Uno; a small board with a simple microcontroller on it.</p>

            <h2>Workshop 1</h2>
            <p>In the first workshop, there were 7 challenges main challenges. I'll show you four of the things I programmed in this challenge:</p>

            <h3>3C: Blinky blinky LEDs</h3>
            <p>First, we learned how to control LEDs: wether they were on or off and to control their brightness through digital pulse-width modulation. In this first example I programmed two LEDs, one of which blinks twice as fast as the other.</p>
