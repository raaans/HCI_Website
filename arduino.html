            <h1>Arduino workshops</h1>
            <p>In these workshops, we learn to program hardware (such as servo-motors, LED displays, etc) with the help of an Adruino Uno; a small board with a simple microcontroller on it.</p>

            <h2 id="workshop1">Workshop 1</h2>
            <p>In the first workshop, there were 7 exercises. I'll show you four of the things I programmed in this challenge:</p>

            <section class="exercise">
                <h3>3C: Blinky blinky LEDs</h3>
                <p>First, we learned how to control LEDs: wether they were on or off and to control their brightness through digital pulse-width modulation. In this first example I programmed two LEDs, one of which blinks twice as fast as the other.</p>

            <section class="exercise">
                <h3>4C: Slow Fade</h3>
                <p>In this exercise, I made sure two LEDs slowly faded in and out. Where the green LED fades out, the red LED fades in, and vice-versa.</p>

            <section class="exercise">
                <h3>6C: This has potentio</h3>
                <p>Using a potentiometer, you can turn a knob to generate a number by measuring the resistance it has. Knob goes left, number goes down. Knob goes right, number goes up. You can of course use this to control the brightness of LEDs:</p>

            <section class="exercise">
                <h3>7C: Welcome to the (LED) matrix</h3>
                <p>Two LEDs? That's boring! How about an 8x8 grid? You can use that for much more! Converting the position of a potentiometer to a number, for example. Very useful.</p>
