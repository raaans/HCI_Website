            <h1>Playful Interaction Challenge</h1>
            <p>In this challenge, I'll be researching, designing and building a "novel interactive experience" using the principles laid out in the 'Playful interaction' classes. This means that you design a mundane interaction, like throwing away garbage or sitting on a bench, and make it more fun to do. </p>

            <div class="sectionContent">
                <p>First, I started looking into what other people had already designed. I came across one project that immediately grabbed my attention, if not just for the lack of detail and concrete description of what it was supposed to do.</p>
                <h3>The intimate bench</h3>
                <p>I came across <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~amnoid/humobile/media/playful_interactivity.pdf" target="_blank">this research paper</a> on playful interaction. I really liked the intimate bench prototype they made. It's a bench with sensors and lights that are supposed to make people sit closer together. The paper doesn't really go into how it's supposed to do that, only that the shapes and lights "act in ways that strenghten the situation". </p>
                
                <p>I really do like the concept, and the lack of in-depth description of how it's supposed to work got my brain going. How can I make a better and more elaborate version of this?</p>

                <p>I first sketched out my idea, to give it a bit of shape:</p>
