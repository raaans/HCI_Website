            <h1>Artificial Creatures Challenge</h1>
            <p>In this challenge, I'll be researching, designing and building an "innovative interactive artificial creature". </p>

            <p>I'll be using the stuff I learned so far about programming Arduino and the things we spoke about in the guest lectures to inform my building process. I'll also be doing some of my own research on the robotics topic to see what's already being done in this field. </p>

                <h3>Lego Boost</h3>
                <p>I came across this product via the <a href="https://robots.ieee.org/" target="_blank">robots.ieee.org website</a>. They have a huge catalog of all kinds of robots, so I've found most of my references there. </p>

                <p>This specifically caught my eye because I definitely was one of those Lego kids - it was practically all I did until I found out about computers. I think it's great that this kind of set exists right now and I'm sure that it would have gotten me into coding and robotics much sooner if it existed back when I was playing with Legos.</p>

                <h3>Sony Aibo</h3>
                <p>Sony's Aibo is a reasonably well-known robot dog originally released in 1999. A new version was introduced in 2017, which was obviously much more sophisticated. What caught my eye now is that Sony released an API for Aibo so that users can teach their dogs new tricks, so to speak.</p>

                <p>As was already highlighted in the talk, robots like this can really help people in a lot of cases, especially lonely elderly for example. Now that Sony released their API to the public, I feel like a whole lot more potential has been unlocked to program specific and helpful behaviours. </p>

                <h3>Anki Cozmo</h3>
                <p>In terms of companions, I just had to write something about Vector - he looks just too cute. </p>

                <img src="https://www.anki.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-anki-content-global/default/dw17b7edd4/vector/landing/vector-home-always-helpful-desktop.jpg" alt="a picture of the Anki Vector">

                <p>So I did. And then I saw Cozmo, the kids and education focused version of Vector. I wrote a whole thing about it being corporate spyware (Amazon Alexa) in a cute package, but this isn't the case with Cozmo. He's more focused on learning kids to code and experiment, and I'm all about that (as you read before). Cozmo seems just a bit more advanced than Lego Boost, although Lego might be a smoother on-ramp to coding.</p>

                <p>Apparently Anki went belly-up sometime last year (but probably found some funding somewhere). I found <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/anki-jibo-and-kuri-what-we-can-learn-from-social-robotics-failures" target="_blank">an article about what we can learn from that</a>, which I found really intriguing. Especially lesson 4 on robotics design really got me thinking and now I'm kind of hooked on the concept.</p>

                <h3>My own Critter on Wheels</h3>
                <p>I started off by using my Arduino kit and some Legos to build a robot that could ride around and would avoid obstacles. My first prototype showed me one problem that I didn't realise before I started building: the servos I had were not continuous servos (meaning they can't continuously rotate). I decided to just keep going to see how far I could get. My second prototype still had some issues, but with a slightly sturdier base, some better fit gears and some WD-40, it worked almost as expected. I just had to revise the code so that both wheels would turn, and it worked!</p>

                <!-- INSERT VIDEO -->
                <!-- INSERT CODE -->

                <p>Too bad I can't fully articulate the servos, but it works as I had hoped it would. Experiment 1 is a success!</p>
